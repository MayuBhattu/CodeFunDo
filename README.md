### Main Idea – To Develop an App and a Database of victims and rescuers to optimize the post disaster management

The App will do the following:-

### On downloading the app:

•	Collect the information of citizens like address, number, gender and age of people in house, contacts for relatives/friends nearby, distance of nearest hospital, willingness to help in case of disaster, if able to. \
•	Collect the information like contact, age, work, gender and previous experiences of volunteers and rescuers who will act during emergency if demanded. Allocate them default locations to act in case of disaster. 

### During disaster:
•	If a disaster is predicted, inform the citizens of it and send precautionary measures, nearest safe zones and danger zones, and contacts of rescuers in their zone in case of emergency. \
•	“I’m safe” and “SOS” options to decide the people in need and the danger/safe locations. \
•	Offline feature to send citizens’ location through message to specific number, using GPS. \
•	Offline First Aid information for different situations. \
•	If internet is available, a map showing the safe and danger zones so as to find the safest path to a safe zone. \
•	Allocate the volunteers and rescuers, on-time, to specific region based on number of people affected and their location.
